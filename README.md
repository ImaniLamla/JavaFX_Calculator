# JavaFX_Calculator <br>
### Description Of The Program: <br>
The JavaFX Calculator is a program that creates a GUI calculator using JavaFX controls and layouts. <br>
### Purpose Of The Program: <br>
The purpose of this project is to create a simple GUI calculator that can perform basic calculator functions. This project was assigned to me by my Programming Fundamentals 2 instructor. I was given the basic code of the JavaFX Calculator but I had to add extra functionality. This project was to teavh the class how to create a GUI using JavaFX. <br>
### Components Of The Program: <br>
The program makes use of 24 Buttons, 1 TextField, and 1 Text control. <br>
The TextField is used to display the values inputted by the user as well as the results of the calculations. The Text control displayed the value stored in memory. The additions I made to the code was adding the power and square root buttons, all memory buttons, the decimal point and backspace button. 
The full set of 24 Buttons consist of: <br>
<ul>
<li>10 Number buttons (0-9)</li>
<li>A decimal point</li>
<li>6 Math operators (+, -, *, /, ^, square root)</li>
<li>4 Memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC)</li>
<li>A backspace button</li>
<li>A clear button</li>
<li>An equals button</li>
</ul> <br>
